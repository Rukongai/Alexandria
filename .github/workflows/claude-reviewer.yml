            1. Read `.claude/agents/reviewer.md` — this is your full review checklist.
            2. Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/CONVENTIONS.md`, and `docs/TYPES.md`.
            3. Run: git diff origin/$BASE_REF...HEAD --name-only
               to get the list of changed files, then read each one.
            4. Apply every check in reviewer.md to the changed code.
            5. Post your findings as a comment on this PR:
               gh pr comment $PR_NUMBER --body "..."

            Format your comment as:
            ## Alexandria Code Review

            **Result:** ✅ No issues found  (or ⚠️ N issue(s) found)

            For each issue:
            - **File:** `path/to/file.ts:line`
            - **Rule:** (what docs/ARCHITECTURE.md or CONVENTIONS.md says)
            - **Fix:** (specific actionable change)

            If no issues are found, say so explicitly and briefly summarize what was checked.
